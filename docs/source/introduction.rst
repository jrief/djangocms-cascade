Introduction
============

**DjangoCMS-Cascade** is a collection of plugins for Django-CMS_ >3.0 to add various HTML elements
from CSS frameworks, such as `Twitter Bootstrap`_ or the `Grid System 960`_ to the Django
templatetag_ placeholder_. This Django App makes it very easy to add other CSS frameworks, or to
extend an existing collection with additional elements.

**DjangoCMS-Cascade** allows web editors to layout their pages, without having to create different
`Django templates`_ for each layout modification. In most cases, one template with one single
placeholder is enough. The editor then can subdivide that placeholder into rows and columns, and
add additional DOM_ elements such as buttons, rulers, or even the Bootstrap Carousel. Some basic
understanding on how the DOM works is required though.

**Twitter Bootstrap** is a well documented CSS framework which gives web designers lots of
possibilities to add a consistent structure to their pages. This collection of `Django-CMS plugins`_
offers a subset of these predefined elements to web designers.

**Grid System 960** is a wildly used CSS framework, which offers a fixed-sized grid system made
out of 12 or alternatively 16 columns.

Extensibility
=============
This module requires one database table with one column to store all data in a JSON object.
Therefore it can easily be extended, because new data structures are added to that JSON object
without requiring a database migration.
