--------------
Check for the latest release of this project on Github_.

Please report bugs or ask questions using the `Issue Tracker`_.

In **DjangoCMS-Cascade** version 0.4.0, the code base has been hugely refactored. If you where using
version 0.3.2 upgrade carefully, since the API changed. Please contact me directly in case you
need help to migrate your projects.


Project's goals
---------------
#. Create a modular system, which allows programmers to add simple widget code, without having to
   implement an extra Django-CMS_ plugins for each of them.

#. Make available a meaningful subset of widgets as available for the most common CSS frameworks,
   such as `Twitter Bootstrap`_ and `Grid System 960`_. With this special **DjangoCMS Plugin**, in
   many configurations, **DjangoCMS** can be operated using one single template, containing one
   generic placeholder.

#. Extend this DjangoCMS plugin, to be used with other CSS frameworks such as `Foundation 5`_,
   Unsemantic_ and others.
