This DjangoCMS plugin originally was derived from https://github.com/divio/djangocms-style, so the
honor for the idea of this software goes to Divio and specially to Patrick Lauber, aka digi604.

However, since my use case is different, I removed all the existing code and replaced it against
something more generic suitable to add a collection of highly configurable plugins.
